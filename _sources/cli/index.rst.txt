 Command-Line Interface
========================

The command-line interface (CLI) makes most of the :ref:`sec-c-api` available
from the command-line. The purpose of the CLI are manifold:

 * The CLI source code serve as example code of using the :ref:`sec-c-api`
 * The CLI itself provide tools for experimentation and debugging
 * A supplement to unit-testing the :ref:`sec-c-api`

Usage of the CLI is described by invoking the commands prefixed with ``nvm_``
without arguments and examples of their use are given in the following
sections.

Additionally, the following general-purpose environment variables can be set to
change the behavior of the CLI.

  * NVM_CLI_NOVERIFY -- When set, disables address verification
  * NVM_CLI_BUF_PR -- When set, read/write commands will dump buffers to stdout
  * NVM_CLI_META_PR -- When set, read/write commands will dump meta to stdout
  * NVM_CLI_ERASE_NADDRS_MAX -- Controls number of addresses pr. erase
  * NVM_CLI_READ_NADDRS_MAX -- Controls number of addresses pr. read
  * NVM_CLI_WRITE_NADDRS_MAX -- Controls number of addresses pr. write

.. NOTE :: This CLI is not meant to be tool for conditioning or
  initialitization of Open-Channel SSDs, for such purposes see `lnvm-tools
  <https://github.com/OpenChannelSSD/lnvm-tools>`_ and `NVMe CLI

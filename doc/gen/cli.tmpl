 Command-Line Interface
========================

The command-line interface (CLI) makes most of the :ref:`sec-c-api`
functionality available from the command-line. The purpose of the CLI are
manyfold:

 * The CLI source code serve as example code of using the :ref:`sec-c-api`
 * The CLI itself provide tools for experimentation and debugging
 * A supplement to unit-testing the :ref:`sec-c-api`

.. note:: This CLI is not meant to be tool for conditioning or initialitization of Open-Channel SSDs, for such purposes see `lvnm-tools <https://github.com/OpenChannelSSD/lnvm-tools>`_ and `NVMe CLI <https://github.com/linux-nvme/nvme-cli>`_

Usage of the CLI is described by invoking the commands without arguments, as
show below. And additionally by optionally defining the following environment
variables:

  * NVM_CLI_NOVERIFY -- When set, address verification is disabled
  * NVM_CLI_BUF_PR -- When set, read/write commands will dump buffers to stdout
  * NVM_CLI_META_PR -- When set, read/write commands will dump meta to stdout
  * NVM_CLI_ERASE_NADDRS_MAX -- Controls number of addresses pr. erase
  * NVM_CLI_READ_NADDRS_MAX -- Controls number of addresses pr. read
  * NVM_CLI_WRITE_NADDRS_MAX -- Controls number of addresses pr. write

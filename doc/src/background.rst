A collection of notes which are nice to know when working with NAND flash
devices.

Device Architecture
===================

 * device geometry
 * parallel units
 * throughput and latency

Media Constraints
=================

 * erase before write
 * write granularities / write constraints
 * read granularities

Media Access Mode
=================

Single vs multi-plane access mode (dual/quad)
